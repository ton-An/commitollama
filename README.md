  - `{{emoji}}`: It will be replaced by the emoji selected in the configuration.
  - `{{message}}`: It will be replaced by the commit message.

## Known Issues

Sometimes, depending on the model used, it can generate quite long commit messages. However, it provides a good starting point for what the commit should be and can be manually edited to achieve the desired length.
